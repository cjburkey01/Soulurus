# Soulurus
A modding project for Minecraft
## The Concept
Have you ever wanted to steal a mob's soul?
### OF COURSE YOU HAVE
Currently, in 1.7.10_1.4, you can steal mob souls and use those souls to spawn more of that mob, and a small system in which data is stored on the player.
## What's Coming Up?
Hopefully a system in which the player will be able to store souls in a cloud network.  The player, then, could use those souls for special powers!
# SOUNDS FUN!
